1. Make the nav a row of buttons aligned to the left of the page
2. Center the hero image inside of the red div
3. Make the capes/tights & sound effects images align in the center of the
   page in a row, with space around each element. Images should wrap to a new
   row if there's not enough room.

When you're done, [it should look like this.](./img/hero-supply-solution.png)
